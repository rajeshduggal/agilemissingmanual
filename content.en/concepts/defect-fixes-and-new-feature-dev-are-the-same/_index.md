# Defect Fixes and new Feature Development are the Same


It's always been interesting for me to see how when we're working at a job project will have used the stories to describe new features that we want to develop and then when we feel the new features are done and QA comes in and takes a look and they see that the future isn't quite right they will create a new bug that needs to be worked on however if you think about it a fresh new project with no software yet and a complete specification of what is required one could say that we need to create a list of features that need to be billed on the flip side one could say that the software is 100% buggy and we could create a complete set of bugs in the system to describe all the things I'm missing essentially is two sides of the same coin in many cases so in general when working on an agile project because it is centered around the idea of change change describes the way we are and where we need to be whether that is creating a new feature or removing an existing feature to replace with something else or to modify an existing feature all of these ideas are the same and should be handled the same way in the system for example let's say we have let's say a request was made to add a person's full name into the system on the specification requested the first name middle name last name however only first name and last name was added into the system at this point and it was the ticket was moved across as being done however event at some point is discovered that it isn't quite correct now there's two ways to address this one way is to create a new user story to say that we also want to include a middle name as a new feature from where we currently are in the system what is currently built into the system another way is to say that the system is broken in that there's a defect in the system and that it is missing the middle name however there is usually no real benefit in trying to figure out if this is a new feature change or a defect change and so in most cases they should be treated the same.
