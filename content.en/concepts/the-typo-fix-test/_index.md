# The Typo Fix Test

Usually when I join a new project I like to consider or ask people in the team in the within the implementation team if you happen to be using the application in production and you notice a typo and a word are you individually do you individually have enough understanding of how to fix that bug and have it the work complete and it end up in production with the fix it doesn't matter if you are a web designer that is Photoshop really you should be able to find a way to find the text this type of spelling error I didn't the source code understand how to use the magic control system make the adjustment have it go run through automated test and deploy it into production all by yourself another thing that can be asked is how long would it take you to do that fix so perhaps the graphic designer doesn't know Java programming but maybe they're able to go and request a job somebody with javit on the expertise to come and take a look at the story and help do the fix with them together in some situations 

Is interesting the types of things we hear sometimes we will hear that deployment can only be done on certain time schedule times or certain times of the week that is dictated by the deployment team other times there's a situation where a change requesting is being made or a defect needs to be filed into the bug tracking software and to be able to do that QA needs to have a complete right of what the bug is even though it's just a spelling issue these are all examples where the development is not being streamlined to be able to be completed quickly instead there are many obstacles from doing something as simple as a typo change
