# Don't Do Agile


Agile is not an adverb you don't do agile we're doing software development in an agile way so that it'

So it's kind of a funny idea so we are not doing agile we are doing software development so when somebody says that they're an agile coach really they should be saying that they are coaching to build software their coaching on how to develop software in an agile way so the question is how is it that there are agile coaches that have never developed software before in fact how is it that there are project agile project managers that's another developed software what does it mean even to be an agile developer it's not the developer that is that we are changing it is the software so really it should be we are a developer that is developing software and energy away or perhaps one could say we are a developer that has knowledge and how to build software and I'm not your way

On a side note I think this just goes to show the power of the man names Microsoft today study at one point which showed how human psychology people react to a domain the strength of people's psychology with a domain name so really the domain is agile manifesto however. Maybe you should have been called a jail software development manifesto pretty wordy right?

On another side side note there is no such thing as building software in a waterfall way waterfall was never a word that was used it was a specific thing described in the paper by Royce that described a grandiose approach to developing software that in fact made sense in some situations and it wasn't something that was being suggested as a way to build Southwest successfully.

And as we and as we as I described in the other article that it should not be just a question of what our preference is whether we build in the traditional way brackets what for brackets or in an agile way it should depend upon the nature of work that needs to be done and the software development processes and systems that are in place to enable it be done in an agile way if the systems are if the systems are set up in such a way that we can use agile then probably should and if the systems are not set up agile we can try to change the systems in advance and prepare things in such a way to be able to accommodate building the software in an agile way and if we can't then maybe make sense to do a complete system design up front and then make this code changes needed
