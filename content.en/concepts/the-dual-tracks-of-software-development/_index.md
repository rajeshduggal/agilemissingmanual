# The Dual Tracks of Software Development

For software development there are some things that need to happen within the Sprint because they have been requested by the product owner/stakeholders the work which is being asked for by the partial nurse/stakeholders is work that should be brought into the Sprint however work that isn't from the product owner/stakeholder and instead maybe coming from some other place in the organization or maybe coming from the need to do security patches or upgrades to the operating system or to other software as in the system those types of things are infrastructure work and not being asked for by the product owner it is not a feature that they are wanting so those types of things need to go into the other track and know within the Sprint so should not be scheduled now if it means that people within the Sprint team need to work on that thing in terms of calculating lusty we should consider those individuals not within the implementation team for the period while they are fixing or working on other aspects of the software development
