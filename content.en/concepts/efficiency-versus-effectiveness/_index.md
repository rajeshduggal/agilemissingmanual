# Efficiency Versus Effectiveness


There is an inverse proportional relationship between efficiency and effectiveness that sounds pretty fancy but what it means essentially is that the more fish efficiency you want in a system the less effective it will be if you consider a laptop computer design it is designed to be very efficient at such that everything is highly crammed together inside the small laptop box casing when if you wanted to make a change to the internals of the laptop it will be very difficult however if you look at a desktop computer and there are lots available to make changes it is very effective however it is not efficient as a very large footprint and is bulky so the idea is not to make things so so deeply efficient we need to have some wiggle room to be able to be effective to be able to have the change needed sometimes this means we may or go purposely for goal conveniences that may make the system more efficient just so that we can maintain the level of effectiveness.
