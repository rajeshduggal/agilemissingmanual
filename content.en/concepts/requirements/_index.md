# Requirements

You should leave within an agile project people talk about requirements however it's often the case where we should be talking about ideas so initially there's an idea to build some feature of build some new functionality once we start building the once we once the idea has been added into the Sprint and we can start working on it then from it we will we will start talking about it as a requirement that we would like to see fulfilled within the software or the idea may change because an idea is just a thought and from that thought we can discuss it and come to other ideas however a requirement is more fun it's something that's being decided and needs to be done it is required why is an idea is something that we can play around with we can try and see what happens and if it seems to be good we can then complete it once it's completed the idea can be deployed and we can see it in action
