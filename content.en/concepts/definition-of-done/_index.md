Since we're following the agile approach, our goal is to try to get new features out into production in incremental parts so that we can get feedback.  And so, to get an increment out there, we should try to make it as small as possible, while keeping the quality high.

And to keep the increment small, and quality high, we should try to have the smallest, and more flexible spec possible.  So rather than spec requiring a certain font to be used. Perhaps the spec can list a preferred font. And so the
