# Ideas

Requirements are compulsary... Ideas are cheap and can be thrown away. Or shelved. From ideas we can build requirements. A BA In a user story there should be "ideas", and "requirements".  E.g. requirements... accessibility, and security compliant.  Idea.. it should have a down arrow in a triangle shape, and use this font. And then be able to drag this component. Requirement, must work in chrome browser and on iphone.


Ideas are flexible maybe you can change your mind on something you can have an idea somebody else can have an idea which is better than your idea or you can think ideas through and formulate your ideas so in this way ideas are very flexible and open to change which is what we're looking for when we're doing that job on the other hand requirements are fixed to change your requirement to we can we can add more details around requirements food typically don't change a requirement when a requirement is sent from stakeholder to the implementation team the implementation team just understands that it needs to be done so imagine a scenario where there's a user interface components framework and it includes a calendar widget no requirement may come from a stakeholder to have the calendar work in a certain way right that is their preference to explain what they would like in terms of user interface however then aware of this technology framework that's being used when the implementer If instead of a requirement coming down from the stakeholder it was an idea then the implement to take that idea understand what it is that needs to be done what is the intention is but can propose something different right a new idea so they can explain to the stakeholder that this framework into these interface framework that's already being used includes a calendar system and it may not be exactly what they had in mind but it may be good enough to implement and put in place and once this becomes live in production they can always then iterate and increment and decide if it's worth the investment to build a proprietary calendaring widget or not the stakeholder may decide that they would further the implementation team spend more of their energy working on a different user story and they will make do with the calendar system calendar widget as it stands as it is however the stakeholder would would not normally know that this calendar's calendar which is available in the existing framework and something that can be leveraged and so I see this time and time again where they'll be a user interface team who will design Pixel perfect graphics get the approval from the stakeholders and then becomes solidified as a requirement and hand it off to the implementation team to now make that exact music interface setup and so there isn't an opportunity for the since there was work done to design it from scratch and also there's and to explain it and describe it to the stakeholders and for the stakeholders to review it and consider it and approve it amongst themselves by the time it comes to the implementation team as a requirement there isn't really much room to consider other things also sometimes the ticket will come with the requirement built in and there's a and then it's estimated as is however if this was an idea an idea was proposed then it keeps things open and flexible so another way of taking this on is for the implementation team to take the idea review it bring in the user interface design specialists within the team confirm with them that this is going to work and it it makes sense visually and from a ux perspective it's acceptable and then there can be some conversation around the idea to decide as a team what might make the most sense and then for the stakeholders to approve that direction
