# Ideas

Requirements are compulsary... Ideas are cheap and can be thrown away. Or shelved. From ideas we can build requirements. A BA In a user story there should be "ideas", and "requirements".  E.g. requirements... accessibility, and security compliant.  Idea.. it should have a down arrow in a triangle shape, and use this font. And then be able to drag this component. Requirement, must work in chrome browser and on iphone.
