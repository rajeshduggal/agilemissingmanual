# Planning Sprints in Advance is an Anti-Pattern

An auntie pattern that I have seen time and time again on various projects is where the work is chopped up is where the project project is chopped up is where the complete software design is chopped up into incremental durations and then all of that work is placed onto a timeline in sprints this is in fact completely opposite of what needs to be done in terms of feedback the agile and idea of agile is to deploy a small piece of work in small additional feature a small change into production so that we can get feedback from it and decide do we want to go this way all that way so the destination shouldn't have been decided in advance it should be played out as we go along having said that this can still be a vision for example if I decide that we should build a some kind of vehicle for example if I decide we should go to San Francisco for vacation and we're driving in that direction as we drive across the country to San Francisco different things may come up perhaps there is a problem on route and we decide that we should cut our trip short and visit some other place or perhaps we find out during our journey we meet another traveler and they suggest we can go to a different city where there is a festival happening that would be more enjoyable for us we can change course or we may decide that where we are now in our journey is good enough and we may want to stay there for the remainder of our trip and not continue on to San Francisco so it is a good idea to have a vision of what the final destination might be however we should be flexible I want that destination is and as we move along in the project we should we should pay close attention to the feedback we receive in and decide while priorities are and decide where we want to go and end up and not be so fun also another problem with this with laying out the springs is that it forces a particular timeline and as we discussed before with the iron triangle forcing a timeline unexpecting the high level of quality means forcing a timeline a complete timeline with the scope of work means that quality becomes a variable and by forcing the by telling the developer team that they are behind schedule as they work through things or by giving the impression to the stakeholders that this is the schedule we will be following the timeline will be following for the work to be complete it causes pressure from the causes the stakeholders to feel that they can pressure the development team into sticking to that schedule and handcuffs the development team since they had a great made a general agreement that that's what was going to be done the correct way to approach this is to prioritize continuously prioritize the work so at the beginning of the project perhaps the idea was to complete steps... A b c d e but then as the work is being done we may discover that in completing step b there was some additional complexities which used up a lot of the budgeting or and our time visuals available and so now we need to reprioritize and so instead of doing feature d it may be decided that feature is more important or maybe there is a whole other approach or other set of work and features that we may decide is better the better use of the limited amount of time and budget resourcing since all of it will not be able to be completed in time over there budget or within budget
