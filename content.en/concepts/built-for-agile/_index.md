# Built For Agile

The common thing that teams overlook is the assume that any project can be done with agile but really the project needs to intentionally be done to be compatible with agile because agile is unfundamentally designed to embrace change but then the software development system itself needs to be ready to take on that change so it doesn't make sense that we have that you've built a very complicated large system and a new change request has come through from the product owner but now to make that change there's uncertainty and fear amongst the team to if that change will break other systems what the impact might be a wet even make that change also the ability to make the change may require a complete new deployment

The change mail to have an impact if there is another downstream system that expects the existing system to work a certain way and making this change May mean we need to now include the concept of versioning into the application so all of these things need to be considered to be able to design the system as we're building it to be able to continue to embrace change intentionally


The original idea of the manifesto was to build the software and situated that it can be changed easily new changes can be added and removed deleted modified this works for software however it doesn't necessarily work with all other systems for example if you wanted to build the entire you cannot build the Intel and agile way to embrace change because the original you cannot build one floor at a time and keep adding a new floor on a new floor without this making sure that the foundation is deep enough as a base so the original specification of the the complete height and design of the CN tower needs to be considered with its weight then understand what the foundation needs to be to then dig deep and establish a strong foundation first ones is being built or partially built the product owner cannot come and decide they want to build a taller still because now that would mean they would have to remove all the existing work to build an even stronger foundation so in this case typically build a building such as a CN such as the entire way software special in this way and that we can add and remove things some more easily and so however that is only the case if the software is built that way intentionally.

And again just to reiterate we are not doing project management in an agile where we're doing software development in an agile way we're not changing the way the that the project is managed we are changing the way that the software is developed.

So if there is a legacy system and we're now going to be making some changes to it it is not correct to assume that we can do this in an agile way we need to consider can we make changes potentially revert back and going to a different direction with the system can we incrementally make changes in a lower square or is agile not correct way to take on this project and instead we should do a deep dive into the other system works Discovery and do a complete big design up front to make sure to make sure that we've covered all the bases so that we can develop the changes in one go and deploy deploy the large the deploy the system and the system changes in one go.
