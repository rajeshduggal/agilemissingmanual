When we were coding when you have an application any application that exists! Go through me tonight is a new version of the operating system patches happen maybe there's a database upgrade or a Java version number which includes security updates and we need to complete maybe the mall the underlying operating system or use it to face has a new update and the application needs to be upgraded to be able to compatible with it perhaps due to the new due to the year on time but due to other systems that interact with the existing system that they need to be some changes and how what export the theater works I'll put up data works the application all of this kind of work is considered to be maintenance and so so where does this maintenance and so this maintenance that happens is not doesn't come at the request of me

So it doesn't really belong in my job or typical Sprint fashion equator development approach because there is not there is a new development coming at the request of you are going to lose money are being built so then you see me a pipeline too with the manager handle these software changes so that needs to be two dual pipelines one pipeline is for the maintenance medicine for pipeline for the Sprint in some cases the

Some cases the future is being requested by the park on with my require some initial infrastructure to be added to the system such as a database or maybe at the database upgrade is needed because it provides some additional features which I needed for me new feature to be built yeah that update might be considered positively maintenance pipeline or it could be considered part of this so this is the decision that needs to be made if it is part of the maintenance then it's not necessarily to be done by the Sprint team by the agile team development team it's something that would happen external and it is a prerequisite for the work to be done by this pretty so all of these things need to be considered as you work as being added because it belong inside this Sprint or does it belong in the maintenance pipeline
