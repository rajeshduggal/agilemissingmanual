# The Role of a Product Owner

Product Owner (owns the stories, they should understand everyone, and if they don't then it doesn't belong in the sprint track, and probably goes into the maintenance track)

At any time of day, they should be able to see a list of all of their stories and understand if they're being worked on right now.  They should be able to read the description and understand it.  They should be able to change stories in the back log.  If they want to change a story that it's in sprint.. then they should discuss it with the team first. (If they're just adding more details, that the team won't be objecting to, then go ahead).

Some product owners have work done scrum agile teams before and are aware of the idea of user stories you exercising incremental design and embracing change and working without fixing the scope and timeline. 

They're also many situations with parked on it doesn't work with such a team and won't be clear on how this thing works it's important to explain how scrum agile works and why so that the price on a doesn't get confused or frustrated when they find out that they won't be told what will be built by when instead they will experience software evolving in a direction that we don't know about yet because as it is being built we will be using it and trying it out and gaining valuable feedback information which will help drive the application forward into whichever direction we are discovering to be the most optimum to achieve the business goals. The business goals maybe clear and well understood but the implementation of the software application might not be at the early stages and so we will build the application with an open mind and see where it leads us we can still have a fixed budget and decide when the application will stop being worked on based on that dollar budget and all timeline and what we have is what we will have and what we have will be high quality and functioning functioning well in terms of what features are included we don't know that yet. We may find that we get less features than however the features that are complete are those that give us the most roi and the most bang for the buck or we may find that in fact we get many features completed very quickly and gives his room to build out the next more advanced functionality into the application that we didn't think would be possible
