# Implementers


Thendividuals in an agile team need to stop calling themselves software developers front and develop a Java developer baqa instead we need to change the perspective to say that we are all one team and we are all going to work together in harmony to work on completing these user stories as he choose a story comes through the different people on the team also known as the implementers will have a different set of knowledge and expertise so perhaps a stick it comes in that says we need to design a forgot password form feature this may require a database change front and change back end change using to face design quality assurance security and so on this one ticket we will need to find different people within the team implementers that have the variety of skill sets that are going to be able to assist in completing this user story perhaps also the amount of QA needed on this use a story is quite basic and so we can have any of the implementers do the QA also the same with the design perhaps we can have anyone design the forgot password page based upon previous other pages in the applications design we don't necessarily need to find who is the phone who is titled designer instead we can look around amongst all of the implementers and ask who has design expertise that can help us with this.

Also should be considered that since some case who is an implementer and who isn't this is impact on the velocity and also it should be understood by the implementers that they should be prepared to learn what is necessary to make changes into the application itself no matter what their background for example if there's a typo on the user interface everybody all of the simple typo all of the implement is on the project should be able to fix that type of check in the code to the deployment to the staging environment all aware of so that it's ready for the product owner to approve no one should be saying hey I don't have access to the source control or hey I don't know how to do the deployment into staging
