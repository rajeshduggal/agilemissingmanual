# The Role of a UX Designer



There are two types of ux designers one is the implementer as an expertise in ux design this person these people should be able to complete the type of fix as discussed and they should be working on stories and assisting to make sure that the ux experience is satisfactory either the same level of satisfaction as before or better. While working on a story they may see that the ux is not great and there is room for improvement they could discuss with the ba or and/or party donors stakeholders to find out if they would like the suggested enhancement to the ux and a you use a story can be added into the system either into the back of the library into the current Sprint depending on how the product owner would like that change to be prioritized 


If the ux experience becomes worse than before should really not be added to  application unless approved by the product owner 

If there if for a given story there are a few ux options that can be chosen then they should reach out to the VA or product on and work with them to decide what is the ux experience they would like to see how this is a story in general the first version I should be whatever you like experience is the minimum needed to help the functionality work and be deployed into production so that we can get feedback maybe the application is not deployed race for a while and there's time to work on the second use a story which means the ux experience I need a kiss the ux should not be broken. 

The other type of ux designer is the one that is not on the implementation team and walks alongside the product owner of the external VA this ux designer May design May create designs which may show a future vision of what the application could be all the general direction that is thought to be g general vision and not the specification the application should evolve into a direction and it might end up being a different ux experience as is being built and evolving.  These experience that may be formed with the product owner might not might not work with the technology stack that's been selected or technology stack that's being selected may have may provide some ux features that can be leveraged to keep the cost development cost low and enable customization and changes that don't require custom development and can help keep the changes to be an expensive and time and resources these are things that the ux designer might not be aware of while working with the product owner outside of the implementation team and this is the reason why the park owner and this ux designer should not design make designs which are concrete and is that should design make designs based on a potential vision of a future 

Should also be understood that these visions that they're being written may not include the iterations in between iterations are not just subset versions of the final design it may be that the early iterations may include features ux features that are temporary and will be dismantled and deleted as other ux features are added in in their place and so from your perspective it should be considered to be okay to add into temporary ux enhancements with an understanding that they will be temporary and will be deleted this is not a bad thing and as part of embracing change and being effective ( versus efficient)
