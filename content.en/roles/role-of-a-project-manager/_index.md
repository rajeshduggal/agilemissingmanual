# The Role of a Project Manager

The project manager shouldn't be running the agile team the team should be self-sufficient and running itself the manager the project manager can should be managing a project and a project is larger than the implementation work if you look at my article about the dual streams I mentioned the idea of the maintenance infrastructure stream and also the new feature development for the for the stakeholders so the project manager should make sure that should try to remove any obstacles from the development team so they can continue working at full pace and also should be looking into the future I'm setting things up so that the team can continue running at full pace this might include making sure to introduce and connect with other teams within the organization or purchasing licenses for the team acquiring the tools that the team is requested are helping to answer any logic questions about the project about the project in relation to at Large 
In terms of features needing to be built within the application that can be the role of the business analyst 

also the project manager doesn't need to be getting involved into the day-to-day running of the standard meetings the team should be able to run those themselves and organize them themselves the project manager shouldn't be needed on the involved in the project every day in fact this means that the team needs to have some internal out of his own leadership skills and often this is something that many developers I'm not comfortable with the loan as we discussed earlier the concept should be that people are implementers within the team what are they implementing the implementing the development of this software solution and what is required to build that software is code design quality assurance infrastructure also some leadership and so this is where people can practice their leadership skills within the team and try it and be encouraged to step forward and help organize the team it shouldn't be that there is one project manager that has responsibility to run the team. 

The analogy I like to use is that of a restaurant where obviously preparing and serving the food is the largest and most important portionportion of the restaurant however. It's not the most it's not the only part of a restaurant you can't run a restaurant with just the kitchen and some tables for people to sit at they still needs to be the day-to-day running of the restaurant establishment there still needs to be stuffing and resourcing that needs to be managed there is still tax and accounting there's still front of door there's still marketing and sales there are many aspects running a restaurant and in the kitchen there's a team of chefs who have a very important job that is to prepare and organize themselves to prepare and service the customers that are coming into the restaurant and keeping the restaurant by purchasing food experience. It wouldn't be right for the restaurant manager to be coming into the kitchen and organizing the chefs and for the chefs to be asking the project manager how to do things in the kitchen the project manager should be able to leave the kitchen staff alone while they go ahead and do what they know they need to do to get the work done I should be there expertise and restaurant manager your manager might be called in now and again. To help with some specific cases perhaps the oven has stopped working and the repair person needs to be called in meanwhile the chefs are busy at work chopping vegetables and grilling meat it should be the project manager who restaurant manager who make who gets the oven working again and removes that obstacle to help keep the chefs streamlined and focused on what they need to do well stuff staying out of their way 

It should be understood that project manager should not be an expert in a software development approach the software developers should be in the experts of sufferedom approach and the project manager should be able to entrust that the development team knows how to implement what needs to be done and has a strong grasp of hi John methodology so that they can complete and follow the values practices and techniques themselves and if they aren't knowledgeable they should be able to research and find out how it's done or consult with an agile coach the project manager needs to be on top of liaison with other teams remove obstacles fix things be concerned about the calendar and budgets and staffing that are all auxiliary to the software development itself.

The project manager should also be aware of any deficits within the implementation team perhaps there isn't enough people to work on the design aspect of quality assurance are and so if we need more of those resources the project manager should be the one to go out and try to find some of that expertise or also consider sending some of the stuff out for training to get an expertise needed essentially the project manager should be there to help find bottlenecks and see if there's a way to optimize and streamline to keep the value stream running at full capacity.
