# The Role of a Business Analyst 

Those two types of b is one severe that is an implementer on the scrum team this person like all the other people on the scrum team implemented on the scrum team should be able to understand how to deploy the code into the local development environment and be able to do a simple typo fix and have it going to production also they would be that answer questions if something the team wasn't sure on how something is supposed to work or what is meant by a story they can go to the person with the ba skill set and ask them to clarify a reward things to gather the information needed to complete the story rather than waiting on the product owner or stakeholders often as well we'll find that would be the VA that's what the BS skill set they'll know how to articulate things well I need the stories such that the technical people will understand what the story is asking for and also the stakeholders and product owners also understand it to bridging that gap of communication the other thing that would be a can do is to notice be aware of similarities so if there is a new email address field in the story perhaps they know of other areas in the application where there's an email address validation happening to make sure that things are consistent across the application 


The other type of ba is the one that sits alongside the product owner and they are not part of the implementation team instead they are representative product owner and help assist with writing music stories and managing them sometimes the product owner will have an idea of their business objective but not know not be very good at what how to cut how to what the application needs to do the feature set of the application the feature set of the application that will be able to realize that business goal and so they may need the help of a business analyst by themselves by their side to help them to write the set of you stories. 

This is not part of the implementation team and so wouldn't need to install the application of the application running internally on there machine but they would be helping to write the news stories with the product owner and also including all the different cases exception flows and alternate flows. Also when the this ba would be able to have a sense of what the developers wouldn't end questions the developers will have and be able to work with the party on there to help gather that information early on to be able to enter it into these stories. The ba is there to help the product owner with documenting some of these things however they are not the ones who are choosing what needs to be built it is the product owner that is deciding how to prioritize things and build things towards building the towards the bill towards the business call and it's deciding where the most roi will be. The b is the one that will help work with thee worked on to document these ideas into the Sprint system.
