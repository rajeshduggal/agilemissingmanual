# Roles and Responsibilities


In typical projects we have different people with expertise and they have job titles the job titles are usually correlated with their skill set for example web designer Java developer database developer these are these are actually skill sets someone can be both a competent Java developer and a web designer where somebody else maybe a ux designer as a may have the skills of a ux designer that they may be responsible for web development ideas

But however on an agile team everybody should be able to wear different hats and nobody since this is a whole team entire team

The other part which should be understood to general concept is that we should always try to make it so that the new feature features can continue to be developed and remove any friction or obstacles in the flow of work that's being done one example might be where there aren't enough skilled people lot of people who are able to make changes certain changes in the software because they're too busy enough of those type of people so rather than having a number of jobs in a number of web designers instead we should have a group of implementers of which some have some some more school than one area then and other people within the team may be school in other areas however in terms of rules and responsibilities everyone all of the implemented should be able to step up and try to take on ticket and use the skill if they get stuck they can collaborate with other people in the team who are more skilled in that area to try and pair and figure out how it's to be done doing things this way it means that we don't wait around for the web designer or away from the child developer instead is somebody feels they can take on this work because it is simple enough to go ahead and take it on irrelevant of what their traditional title is are used to be instead they're just a person that is trying to implement the story and implement the work also this opens the opportunity for cross-pollination and learning other system across multiple people on the team which accelerates it accelerates which reduces friction going forward into future sprints since there are more people more and more people within the team that are gaining and understanding of the different areas of the software the different components of the software and they're able to take on the use the story tickets as they are as they are available in the Sprint.
