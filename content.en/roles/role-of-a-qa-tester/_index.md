# The Role of a QA Tester

The QA tester is on the implementation team and so they should be able to have the software installed on the Brooklyn environment and know how to complete the typo fix test. Because the cubic tester is an implementer as well they should be able to go ahead and fix the bugs as they see them they're not a their first and foremost implemented before they are QA tester however because they have expertise in QA in testing they would have a experience and a good sense of all the different areas that should be focused on in terms of where risks may be for bugs to be sleeping through and where the focus should be on confirming that the application is working to specification and is of high quality. 
implementer identifies a bug you can decide if this issue is going to hold back these authority or as if the user stories are still good enough to potentially be deployed into production and an additional user story needs to be written to describe some additional work that needs to be done and can confirm this with the VA or product on that to have this added into the backlog or into this current Sprint depending on the urgency of this work 

It's important to remember that nobody is AQA testing person things should not be assigned to a QA tester person instead all the user stories should be worked on by implementers and different implementers have different expertise some implementers have a background and expertise in a quality assurance and testing.  

This type of work is requires much more thought than expertise then someone simply running through a set of basic point and click test cases instead the person in this role would be looking for ways to automate this thing and themselves be understanding the code to understand where the potential risk of based on how the code is structured.

That does not need to be a QA environment that the QA testers work on instead there should be the development environment and the people with QA expertise should be checking out the code branch for the story and making sure that the testing is that the quality of that your story is is high before it is merged into the main branch.

Some teams like to hire an external third party vendor to do the testing that's fine however those people would not be on the implementation team and not would not necessarily and then so would not have the code base installed in the machine and be running the typo fix 
Instead those people could be working behind the scenes just to be an extra layer to confirm that things are working as expected

It should be understood that the quality of the of the code in the branches are already up to spec before they merged into the main branch and so it should be a big surprise if an external q18 is able to find bugs and if they do find bugs and it means that something within the user story within the team when these has been work on was not completed fully and perhaps it needed more focus on testing to make sure that the code to the Future that the feature is coded to completion and to spec before it's merged into the main branch and in general the main branch should be a very very high quality at all times
