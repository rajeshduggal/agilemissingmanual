# The Two Types of Unit Tests

 
The two types of unit tests one is to help steered the design of the application referencing this with has driven development this helps to organize a modular modularize the software components so that they're easy to understand read and follow their sentence and practices around it see solid by Steve Uncle Bob.  This can help with keeping the application code organized in a way that makes it keeps makes it easier easy going forward to be able to add new functionality change things and keep things coherent for the developers that are will be building on the large application in the future and adding new functionality into the existing system again with an idea of keeping the code self-documenting so that the developers can understand what's going on in the code just by reading the code alone without needing to refer to additional developer docs are verbose comments 

These are types of unit tests are for code coverage to confirm that the application is performing has been confirmed to perform correctly for example email address validation there may be many test cases to test variety of email address formats so that we can confirm that validation is working correctly. 

Sometimes I'll see a project where they will only have the second type of unit test which means which is great and that we can be sure that some of the different cases of the application validation etc are working correctly however it doesn't mean that the design of the application code is good I will be easy to change my forward and add new functionality so when we have to projects one both may be at 80% code coverage it's not completely it's not very meaningful in terms of how this impacts new work coming in new functionality coming in it does not it does not give a clear indication of how long it will take to complete the new to make those code changes to add the new functionality so management so typically management doesn't understand this and so they don't have a clear understanding of why 80% maybe a good scar in this project and 80% maybe a poor score in  this other project. 

These unit test should be more of the concern of the implementation team the developers and the people and the people who are specialized in quality assurance within the implementation team and it should be then to use to help them be confident that the application is running well and it's also useful for people that are new to the project to be able to jump in and have the courage to start making code changes quickly.
