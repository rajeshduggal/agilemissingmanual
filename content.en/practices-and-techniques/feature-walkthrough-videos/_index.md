# Ditch the Sprint Review Demos: Use Walkthrough Videos Instead

Traditionally, teams wait until the Sprint Review to present newly completed features to stakeholders and the rest of the team. But there’s a better way! Recording individual walkthrough videos for each new feature—right after it’s built—provides flexibility, speeds up the feedback loop, and ensures that everyone stays updated throughout the sprint.

Instead of waiting until the end of the sprint to showcase work, teams can record quick demos as features are completed. By organizing these videos in a shared location, they become a valuable resource for the team, offering multiple benefits over the standard “Sprint Review” presentation.

## Benefits of Feature Walkthrough Videos

Let’s look at some of the key advantages of recording walkthrough videos for new features:

1. **Watch at Your Own Convenience**

   A video walkthrough means team members, stakeholders, and even external users can view the new feature at their own pace. No more coordinating schedules or sitting through lengthy review sessions to catch up on the latest features. Everyone can access the video when it works best for them, improving engagement without interrupting workflows.

2. **Review Again at Any Time**

   Once recorded, videos become a lasting resource. Stakeholders can revisit videos whenever they need a refresher, or when they want to reference a feature as it evolves. This is particularly helpful if someone joins the project mid-sprint or needs to see how a feature has changed over time.

3. **Stay Updated in Real Time, Not Just at Sprint’s End**

   Waiting until the Sprint Review to demo features means that the rest of the team and stakeholders may be left in the dark until the end of the sprint. By recording walkthroughs immediately after a feature is built, team members can stay updated on progress as it happens, understanding the new functionality and how it fits into the overall product vision.

4. **Faster Feedback Loop**

   Walkthrough videos allow stakeholders and team members to provide feedback as soon as they view the feature, rather than waiting for the next Sprint Review. This keeps the feedback loop tight, making it easier to catch potential issues early. A fast feedback cycle helps the team make adjustments while the work is still fresh, reducing rework and ensuring the product better aligns with user needs.

5. **Easy Re-Recording as Features Evolve**

   Agile development is all about adaptability, and walkthrough videos make it easy to keep everyone updated as features change. If additional modifications are made to a feature, simply record a new video. This keeps everyone up-to-date on the latest version without requiring lengthy explanations during review sessions.

## How to Organize and Share Walkthrough Videos

To maximize the benefits of video walkthroughs, it’s important to keep them organized and easily accessible. Here are some tips for managing these videos:

- **Create a Shared Repository**: Use a shared platform or repository (e.g., a project management tool, cloud storage, or a dedicated folder) where everyone on the team can access videos. Organize videos by sprint, feature name, or project section to make it easy to find specific walkthroughs.

- **Add Annotations or Time Stamps**: For complex features, consider adding annotations or time stamps within the video or in the description. This makes it easier for viewers to jump directly to specific parts or key interactions.

- **Encourage Timely Feedback**: Set up a process for gathering feedback on walkthrough videos, such as a dedicated channel, thread, or comments section. This encourages everyone to watch and respond promptly, keeping the feedback loop active.

- **Notify the Team When a New Video Is Available**: A quick notification (in Slack, email, or the project management tool) lets the team know a new walkthrough video is available for viewing. This keeps everyone in the loop without the need for a formal presentation.

## Why Walkthrough Videos Work Better Than Sprint Reviews

Recording walkthrough videos offers several advantages over traditional Sprint Review demos:

- **Flexible and On-Demand**: With videos, team members and stakeholders can watch whenever it’s convenient, without scheduling a specific time.

- **Engaging and Efficient**: Videos can be shorter and more engaging than lengthy review sessions, keeping attention focused on the new feature without the distractions of an extended meeting.

- **Forward-Focused Sprint Reviews**: By shifting demos out of the Sprint Review, the meeting can be used for broader, forward-looking discussions instead of focusing solely on what was built in the past sprint. This allows the team to steer the project in the right direction rather than rehashing completed work.

- **Easily Replaced or Updated**: Features often go through multiple iterations. With a video, it’s easy to re-record or add updated walkthroughs as changes are made, keeping everyone up-to-date on the latest version without confusion.

## Conclusion: Embrace Walkthrough Videos for a Smarter Workflow

Switching from Sprint Review demos to individual walkthrough videos can revolutionize how your team collaborates, communicates, and responds to feedback. With on-demand videos, everyone can stay informed at their own pace, offer timely feedback, and maintain a continuous feedback loop throughout the sprint. Agile is all about adaptability and responsiveness, and using walkthrough videos is a simple, effective way to make the process smoother and more flexible.
