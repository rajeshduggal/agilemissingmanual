# Documentation

The documentation is just another artifact just like the graphics the code base the unit tests validation rules database schema all of these things are artifacts of the application under version control and so to show the documentation we should be able to roll back the software to an older version and along with it the documentation should be rolled back to what this means is that the people writing the software should know how to check in the documentation into the vision control system alongside the software that is describing that version of the software that is describing also as developers are making changes to the cold they should be able to go in and modify the documentation at the same time as part of the user story you should always be understood that writing documentation takes time and effort and so it can add to the work effort or add to the estimation of the Easter story so writing documentation as a cost and so it should be decided it should be evaluated whether it's worth writing documentary which parts of the application should have documentation written for it 

Ideally for myself with perspective if we're using good class names object names variable names then the software can be self-describing and easy to follow and wouldn't need additional documentation separate documentation to be written the same is always true for these interface if these interface is intuitive as it is and they words on the buttons and controls are easy and intuitive to understand then additional help and documentation may not be needed or at least may be able to be minimized so rather than building Federal in depth complete documentation , which then has a maintenance cost instead we should try to find ways to have the system be clear on its intention and not require too much additional documentation.
