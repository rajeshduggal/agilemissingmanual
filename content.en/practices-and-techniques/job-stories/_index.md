# Job Stories

If you consider the original way that you stories with supposed to be written they were just simple sentences describing a basic idea of what needed to be done this was replacing the idea of formal use cases which were more of a boss and written in a structured form I use the story by contrast was more informal and allowed and was flexible in that they weren't any fix rules on how they should be written instead the focus was on communicating the idea to the reader. 

Later on we started to get the format of as a I would like to so that. Which is fine and that it helps you think about as you're writing it it helps you think about what it is your building and for whom why they would want it but all of this really isn't necessary that's what since the focus is on working software as opposed to following a particular way of doing things we shouldn't put too much emphasis on formulating these sentences in such a way in a specific way having said all that this is being conversation about improving evolving this improving the idea of user stories to instead be job stories here are some links you can learn about it and considerate using them also as a tool to communicate what it is you'd like to do again that doesn't need to be we should be careful of making formal rules women are needed and instead we should introduce different optional tools that we can choose to use when we feel it is appropriate.
Job stories is one such dual use of stories is another tool use cases are another tool or just playing sentences and also work so don't get stuck on requiring the team using just one style
