# User Interface Design

I find how many projects this is often a design team and the design team will drop beautiful graphics showing the final product of how this thing should look however often design isn't following an iterative incremental approach MVP approach instead they're thinking what would be the best most optimum user interface sometimes that interface is not easy to build or it is easy to build but it takes time to build it and and postponing having a feature built because the interface needs to be in such a way is an anti-pattern because it's more important to have the feature feature or functionality working the end user so they can get what they need from it and provide feedback as a priority to the look and feel an example of this might be having a plain text listing of data which may be a bit cumbersome to use and perhaps requires to use it to hit control left on the keyboard to find what they're looking for and perhaps the design team would never design such a interface because it is a bit cumbersome to use however we can very quickly build this kind of interface and deploy it and make it available for the end user the end users can then give us feedback on what they're seeing and say that the data isn't what they want or maybe there's other information that they would like or maybe the information that we're offering them isn't very useful for them I didn't provide much value as we get the feedback we can at the same time be building out the improved design which may include graphs filtering search sorting however we should be careful to not build all of these using interface features prioritize on building them we should prioritize on putting making functionality available at the end he uses so that we can get the feedback also it can be the case that they could be some very fancy use it to face design and it takes time to build with drag and drop another functionality and when we provide the customer we may think we have accomplished building what the design 


It may be that the design team interface with the end users interviewed them and confirmed how the UI should work perhaps with some sliders drag and drop color coding etc the end-user feels like that's what they need I would like ideally the design team draws it up in the design tools hands it off to the implementation team and once the implementation team is built it that functionality is considered to be done and is handed off to the end user there is a misconception that there was feedback given because the end users were involved in the original design discussions however there can be a very different it can be a very different thing to actually use it use that functionality within the application so better approach is to provide the data in the application as soon as possible to the end user even if it's in a basic way have them confirm that this information is useful and then it may be that the user will say this is good enough I can work with this I would rather you work on some other building out some other functionality in the application rather than spending energy and time building and redesigning this piece to look more beautiful I'll provide filtering and sorting and other functionality which are merely nice to have but not as important as other functionality within the web application that we could be focused on building right now we should always be viewing things in incremental approach and not trying to make everything designed and beautiful designed and just right and beautiful and instead we should try to get functionality working that is just good enough and then confirm from the stakeholders what they would like us to focus on that would give them the most value as and uses of the system rather than as trying to complete what the design team has drawn out 


Also I have some time seen where the design team will draw a components and they will incrementally add additional components to a page perhaps shifting things around here and there a bit however if we're truly going to follow an incremental iterative agile approach we should be prepared to build things in and then destroy or delete them and replace them with new user interface features for example perhaps there's a listing perhaps that it should be a design for how to list calendar events nicely on a page and then the next design might be to scrap that and replace it completely with a full monthly calendar view using an internal calendar widget provided by the framework and then maybe the next iteration is to scrap that completely and build a custom calendar component now for each of these iterations that would it would require some conversation with the development team and with the end users and so this type of work and these types of conversations should happen while they use a story is in while he's a story is in the Sprint we can confirm we can have a general high-level conversation about a general idea of what the increments in iterations and increments might be without and shaking without being stuck to those iterations and increments what we do need to solidify on is what is the very first iteration/increment that we're going to do now we can always change your mind and what we do after and try to make that in integration/increment as well as possible and try to get it out into production quickly this is also why it's best to try to keep documentation small because if you have many different increments in iterations it may require reworking the documentation over and over again so in general in approaching this with an idea of change often it's easiest to change text in documentation rather than images and so we can describe things in text and documentation and if we do use images perhaps we shouldn't include screenshots instead perhaps we shouldn't include diagrams and instead we should include direct screenshots from the application or diagram the application diagrams of the interface that are easy to update by the team and not require sophisticated tools from design experts 

This also speaks to having implementers that have expertise in design these people can be involved in working on the user stories and that are in Sprint and work on updating the documentation with the graphics and also can help provide guidance and direction it doesn't need to be that the stakeholders know exactly what they're going to be seeing in terms of design on the interface before the story has started however they should have a strong idea of what the functionality of the story will be because the value comes from the functionality not the design. Design helps to accommodate the functionality.
