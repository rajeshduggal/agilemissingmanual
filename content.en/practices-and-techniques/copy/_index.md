# Copy

Sometimes I've seen tickets that are developed and then as they're being coded there is a edge case where there's a error message that needs to be added to handle an edge case scenario and what happens is the ticket goes on hold as we wait for the copy to be approved by the stakeholders or to be chosen by the copyright copyrighters these things slow down the movement of the ticket instead it would be better if the implementer can themself make a sentence that they think makes sense perhaps they check with another person or QA just to make sure that it seems fine and is consistent and then the ticket can move forward and a request can be sent in to the copy team to approve or provide official text if the text that the implementation team has chosen is good enough for production then the tickets should be able to move forward should not be held back and when the official text copy text becomes available we should be able to update that in the ticket in fact I'm potential if necessary if it makes sense we can create a new use a story to have that text replaced the key is to always keep the tickets flowing I'm not have and minimize the amount of stand still awaiting dating if this if and always have a good enough mindset. 


When reviewing, the developer can put some text in.. and tag it. (CopyTBR)  To Be Reviewed.. then a copy expert can review it and change it. Once it's reviewed (and perhaps changed) it can be changed to (Reviewed RKD 20240411)... in the code.

Graphics can be done the same way, quickly by the dev. (ImgTBR) etc etc. If it's been updated by the developer. Or the file name can be RedLogo-TBR.jpg
