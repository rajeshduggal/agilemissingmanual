# Deploy Before it's Feature Complete


 I've seen many situations where the story is written and describes a variety of features that would be as part of these a story and everything and the ticket does not get deployed until all of those features are fully functional and future complete for example if you have a table with a sort with the ability to sort each column a scenario can say that can happen is that to salt most of the columns is straightforward however one column maybe then if you generated I'm not easy to sort and so the ticket is held while the implementation team tried to look to make that sort feature I'm not complicated complex composite column a better approach would be to deploy the application deploy the feature even though it's not feature complete however it is still working and then later on come back and then later on build that next piece that build that sort feature what this means is when I use a story is in development the implementation implemented should be looking for some situations looking for things that might be more complicated to implement instead of implementing it they should consider can it be can it be put into a new story and remove from this one that way the stakeholders can that way the story can be more quickly moved into production without being held back due to one piece being difficult to implement or complicated implement and then when would the if the stakeholders decide that there's more urgency in building something else in the application they may postpone building a salt feature on that column because perhaps the table is not used by many people and obscure and maybe there is something in the login page or some other primary area of the application that they would like to prioritize work on also by moving the table into production sooner they can get feedback and they decide that the table as it is being designed and implemented isn't ideal anyway and so it doesn't we don't need to have that column salt feature on there because they may decide to remove the column for example and so in that way time is saved.
