# First Iterations



I've noticed a lot in a lot of teams teams get stuck on how to start on a iterative incremental approach when they don't have any infrastructure sometimes I'll see a team where before they begin the Sprint they start building the infrastructure first to get the hosting the database web server setup and user accounts built get everything pulled down even get the initial get commits ready with the framework installed and then once I have all of the initial pieces together they start hey start the initial Sprint.

Or sometimes they'll say well on the final version of the application the usual first come to the site and they'll be a login screen so right away they'll create login as the very first iteration however isn't the best way to do it what I found to work well is to start the Sprint right away and the initial story may be I would like a web I would like to be able to visit a URL and see a homepage which consists of an image from the title from this alone we can split this we can create some tasks from this initially the initial work will be just to grab a logo or jpeg from somewhere random jpeg and then create a deployment path perhaps the static HTML page or the jpeg Wheels need to have a website of so that website and you should be running on a host so that needs to also be acquired and then we will instead of manually uploading the instead of just manually we will as we're developing just my new perhaps just manually upload the HTML page and JPEG to the web server to confirm that it works we can access that URL but then since we're doing agile and we're trying to embrace change and have rapid application development we need to build some automation around we may need to build some automation around the deployment and also build some visual control infrastructure I have to get once we've so from that initial story of the particular asking for a URL website URL we can we can set up production now with production might not want it to be visible to the general public so we can pass a protect it in the meantime or configure configure it to only be available to the product wellness to start however I should still be the production environment the reason for this is that sometimes things will work in staging on local environments but then later on if we postpone respond applying to production we may at that time later time realize that there are some problems without application in the way it can be deployed to production or the availability of the production systems so at least if the problems exist if we start at the very first iteration it will uncover any potential roadblocks or issues with having the website live in production and so by putting the graphic and title and simple HTML pag
