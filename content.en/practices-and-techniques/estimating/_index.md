# Estimating User Stories

 A very common problem I see is where the team is estimating on user stories and then they negotiate that estimation with the stakeholders and the stakeholders use those numbers to force the implementation team to complete the work that they had estimated on within the timeframe they were given as we've discussed into the articles this is a road towards a disaster and low quality software because as a discussed earlier quality is a variable

The reason why we are estimating a new stories is because we need to decide what to bring into the Sprint and focus our efforts on and discuss and to expand our our expander understanding and depth of the ask we cannot we cannot work on everything in everything all user stories in the Sprint we have to pick a subset how do we pick that subset to choose it we have to have a measure of how much we think we can come how much we think we can take on and this is what estimation is for estimation is merely to help us understand to choose a subset of work to be done in the Sprint that's all weather whether it all gets done or not is not the point no one should be blamed for having incorrect estimation if we happen so happens that all of the work gets done early then that's great we can pull in more use of stories from the backlog if it so happens that we don't get everything completed because they were additional discoveries are understandings that came about from these stories as they were being worked on in the Sprint that is fine to we should just deploy what we should make an assessment and deploy what makes sense or even consider postponing extending the Sprint if needed just to wrap up and finish the story or two 

In general it might not be a good idea to pull in a user story into the Sprint when the Sprint is about to finish and they use a story won't be finished in time so perhaps even if a story is within the Sprint back in the Sprint to be worked on if we think it won't be done in the time frame we can pull that use a story out and put it back into the put it back into the top of the at the top of the back log to be worked on in the next Sprint that should be no problem on the thing to be concerned about its business as usual
