# Don't get Attached

Because we keep changing code we're embracing change when we're doing agile we should not only think incrementally you should also consider the idea of going in a direction and then reversing back and changing course for example if we build a table that describes some data we may we may already we made previously have had a vision to have a graph however the graph however the however before we build a graphs it may be easier to build the table. It may be decided that a little graph is ideal the table might be good enough for the people who are reading it and a graph my provide only addition minimal additional benefits. If we do go with the graph later on then we may need to delete that table so as we're building code and software designs of being put together we shouldn't get to attached to the work we should be attached to the value received from the end users and stakeholders and so we should be prepared to delete code we've written or reverse work we've put in to help towards that goal of and use a satisfaction with the software. Even as we write a user story we should have a section called assumptions and acknowledgments under the acknowledgment we can say this is a partial solution or intermediary solution of a table that we are going to build however eventually this will likely be removed and replaced with a graph so that way the implements no that whatever work they do in this user story is likely to be deleted at Future and they should not get to attached to the code
