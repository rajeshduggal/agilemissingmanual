# There Are More Users Than You Think!

You should read my article about your stories and how I don't necessarily feel like it's the best way I don't think there should be a ruled always great use of stories in the format of as a ex we need why so that w however 

When I have been a project that have this format and they use the stories I've noticed that the users are always generally always going to be uses that log into the system into the web application however there's actually more users than that you should consider who else has an interest in being involved in the application so one would be the supports people they have requirements of the application the administrator has requirements the application even in terms of leadership would like to be able to see some reports are extract some information about the usage of the application we could also consider external teams as being used as of the application in that they retrieve information also we can consider users as other applications that use this application right so that user doesn't have to be a human being it can be an external application that is expecting to retrieve some information so perhaps into the application is expecting to see a data file available on being made available for it or an endpoint API call needs to be available for the other system the other system being the user of this application so a user doesn't always have to be a human being 

In general if there's some use for something there is a user 

Another way of considering this is to think this didn't feature didn't exist who would be upset about it who would not who would be missing out or not who is who is upset that this doesn't which person or system is lacking due to this feature not existing and usually that would be your user
