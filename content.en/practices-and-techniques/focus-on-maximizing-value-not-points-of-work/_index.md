# Focus on Maximizing Value not Points of Work


Often teams will get too focused on how many points of work were completed in the Sprint and often that's the measure that is used however it would be better if there was some way to score each user story with value and so it could be that for example on the on the main page then maybe some text which isn't clear and is confusing users but if we change that text it would increase the usability of the application tremendously and provide a lot of value and clarity to the end user however changing the text might be very simple change so completing that story should actually be rated highly by the product owner even though the amount of points to do the actual work is very small so what's the speaking to is importance of organizing the user stories well and prioritizing them properly now we can't always just pick the stories with the highest value because stories will have dependencies we cannot build the final report of the application before we have built the homepage the first page of the login functionality so things need to happen in somewhat in the correct order however at the same time the team should always be focused on maximizing value returned per Sprint for each Sprint 

If it takes longer than was expected to complete some stories within a Sprint should not be considered it should not be considered too much of a serious thing the team should be committed to focusing on the work and ideally over time they will get better and better at estimating how long things take as things become more how most things become clear on how on the steps needed to implement them so 

Can often see this highlighted when we have a demo product demo and sometimes the product on the seas everything that was done and is not impressed because there's not much new functionality available being demoed to get the park on excited even though the team implementation team feels very accomplished because they got so much work done and so here is the mismatch the focus of the entire team should be on fighting value and if the developer can see that there are some small fixes that can be done that would increase quick easy fixes that can be done that will increase the value to the end use of these are things that can be highlighted brought to the attention of the product owner so they can choose to add it into the backlog or even into the current Sprint if there's space and we can get the returns on that bit of work being completed 

From a leadership perspective as well rather than looking at reports of how many points were completed over time it would be wise to consider how much value has been extracted how much value has been built first overtime for the project initially most of the value will happen initially as we build the bulk of the main feature sets later on the smaller features will be built in incrementally and the they will often be diminishing returns on the value received by the end user and so if the leadership has an understanding of this they can decide when they want to stop project stop development on the project and feel it is good enough and that team should focus on some new project on they can put their money towards something else because the main primary functionality is being achieved and the value and the cost of keeping the team working on this project maybe constant but the value received maybe decreasing over time
