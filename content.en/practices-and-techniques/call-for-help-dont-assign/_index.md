# Call For Help, Don't Assign




I've noticed as well that on many people will add additional swim Lanes columns injera and they like to move the stories from from the start to development and then to QA and then to done the problem with this is that the story should not be in qf is the stories either being worked on or not being worked on right you see that to be done to be started in development or done while it's in development at different times there may be a need for people with different specialties different skill sets to be brought into the to the story to help work on certain aspects of what needs to be done in certain cases we may need a story may need some expertise around using face design or perhaps somebody knows about database or have somebody knows Java or somebody knows French translation these tickets should not move or be assigned to somebody to work on the French translation of the Java or the database instead a ticket should exist and people should be requested in so somehow software should we should if I'm working on that story and I may Java developer and I've changed some phrase because I'm as I'm building it I've realized that the link I need to reference I need to change some of the wedding some of the English wording and now he's translation I don't want to assign the story to a translate and wait for them to work and then bring it back to me I want to keep this ticket in play being developed and worked on and different people with different expertise can come in and apply there then apply the work and changes to the ticket together and collaborate together in some cases 

I see this off most often in the case with QA so QA wait until the story is completely done and then the ticket moves from development into QA and the QA look at it for the first time however really when the ticket starts there might be an opportunity for QA to come in somebody with QA expertise to look at the story and discuss it and say oh you know we see that in the software in this user story then maybe I need to test the email address validation and they may say oh we have an email validation in another section another area of the application so we should leverage the same also then the developer can say well we're not going to copy we're not going to duplicate that logic we can actually leverage that exact same validation code base what that means is that from a quick perspective since we since the email validation has already been tested quality and a proof of quality is already in production and this new code it will just be calling that existing validation code we don't need to retest all the validation again we can just confirm that there is some validation and then it will be an understanding that all of the validation that needs to be in place will be in place and consistent however if the situation is that new code needs to be written to do the validation perhaps because it's in a different language software like programming language then we will need to go through a complete set of unit tests to validate so if I'm a cute perspective it's important to understand these things so that the correct so that correct focus can be so that they can so that from a quality perspective we can focus on focus attention on testing the correct areas of the code that needs to be tested 

Also if the if the ticket is assigned to design and ux design and the designers are in the designers are reviewing it and designing a calendar widget there's an opportunity for them to talk to the developers to see if there's already an existing if they are planning on using an existing calendaring widget already available in the framework and that calendar would you coming from the framework has already been tested by the developers of that kind of widget however the calendar widget is proprietary and custom built than it would need to be tested by the QA team it's all of these things need to be considered in terms of where the folks and attention needs to be from a group perspective sometimes the end of some development is done portion of development is done on a user story and it can be tested right away while the next part of the development is being worked on in unison and wants the other part is being completed then QA can be called in again somebody to do the QA testing can be called in again on the story can be requested to come in again on the story and test second part so rather than the development of the second part is happening in unison of the QA testing on the first part of these story and so for this reason it doesn't make sense to us to assign the ticket they use a story ticket to somebody instead people with the necessary expertise should be requested to come in to the story and help complete the pieces that need the work that needs to be done on the ticket 


If you want to get more fancy you could even assign level one expertise person or level 2 expertise person if it's a level one then that would be an opening for a junior or present to come in and test or even somebody who doesn't have specific that specific expertise to come in and test for example if we just wanted to test that type of fix has been done then it may not need and it's just visual then it might not need than anybody in the team might be able to come in and perform that test and approve it however if the testing is more complicated in nature related to some automation testing of and which requires seeding some data in the database first then it may need a level to person expertise person to come in onto these story to do that work and we should encourage level one type of requests so that other people more people than the team can come in on the ticket and become familiar with that new with that user story and the work around it and they can be some more cross-pollination in general awareness of by each member on into different areas of the system that are being developed
