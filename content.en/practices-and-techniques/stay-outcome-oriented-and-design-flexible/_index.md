# Staying Outcome Oriented and Design Flexible

I've often seen projects where there is a design document that's written which explains all the different components that the application should use for consistency however this is great however we should also consider that they focus should always be on the end user experience are they able to get used to use this application to accomplish their task and so we should always stay outcome oriented having a having a guy graphic design guide book is great as a general to provide a general direction in terms of design however the focus should be on what is the outcome for the end user perhaps for the for most of the website it makes sense to use a specific type of design however on any given age or if I need particular use a story the team should be comfortable to deviate away from that guidebook if they feel that the outcome will be better for the end user. This shouldn't be a hard requirement to follow the guidebook instead it should be a soft requirement or soft suggestion and then has the application is being built there should be flexibility in the design so that in such to make sure that the end user is reaping all the potential benefits of the application to achieve that to complete that task.
