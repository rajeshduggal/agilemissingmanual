# Dependencies

When we're building software we always want to build in a situation where we can easily change things and also minimize the risks involved so the more dependencies we have the more risk and the more risk we have in the project and the potentially more difficult it is to make changes so for example if we are going to upgrade the version of java to the next version we may have dependencies on compatible with that version external dependencies which we may have no control over so it may be better to not use those external dependencies and instead for us to have the have the small amount of logic that technology that we need in within application sometimes this means that if there is a utility library that we like would like to use one very small part of it we should feel comfortable copying and pasting that small piece of software into our software rather than including me as a dependency of course this comes in the shoes in that if there are bugs or security patches made available on the Excel dependency we won't be capturing these since we copy and pasted at a particular time so we would need to go back and see if there's any mean any changes I'll fix this to that code so a decision needs to be made about leveraging the dependency or not but in general we should not be willingly including whatever dependencies we like into the application we should be careful and cautious and try to limit the dependence of dependencies as much as possible so that we can continue moving at full speed. 

If there are dependencies we can also try to mock them out for a unit test and try to preserve the logic within a very controlled component so rather than building our software logic into an existing framework we can try to build the logic in a library component which we will include into the  framework. Which can help speed up our unit tests and continuous integration because we're not testing an application through a framework instead we are testing the logic as it is one way to approach this is to actually build a command line application that will test the logic in the library and also just use a very plain text plain text on memory based storage and right our unit tests around that in the actual application it may use a web framework to be run in a browser and use a fully-fledged database relational database but those things will have been tested and qaid by those project teams that build those dependencies it's generallynot I would it's not necessary for us to run our tests through the stack of web frameworks browsers and relational databases just to confirm that our small amount of logic is working correctly and our unit tests. 

Also it is important to consider that if we are using external dependencies that those dependencies have many people involved if it's open source it has many people involved in building it in some cases I've seen projects where they have included in a cool library that was built a few years ago and the developer has now abandoned that project and that application logic is stuck in an old version of the programming language making it difficult for us to upgrade. 

In other situations that have been dependencies on libraries or technologies that are built by a company and that company has decided to change direction and no longer build that application or the company has become defunct and now it is affected how we are building our application and maintaining our application going forward we should generally be considering that our application May last for years and years and the dependencies that we rely on may not be worked on for years and years to keep it up to date with the technology stack going forward until all these things need to be considered when choosing technologies.
