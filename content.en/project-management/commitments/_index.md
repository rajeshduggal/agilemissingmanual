# Commitments

For some reason the word commitment has become a very common would use within a job teams however is not used in the right way or the right place the commitment should be that the implementation team of focused on a committing to focus on providing high value within each Sprint and also to stay focused on the current work in the current Sprint and not be distracted by Future ideas and concepts too much that can be meetings to discuss the future and the vision and the direction once those meetings are done the implementation team should get back to building with the next iteration incremental iteration is and delivering that because at any point that might be the last one stakeholders may choose to end the project or complete development on the project anytime and that I'm a team should be ready for that ideally they shouldn't be any outstanding work and needs to be done in two or three sprints time that is necessary before closing up the project with each iteration the project should be in a high quality working complete within quotes situation 

Often people will talk about the development implementation team committing to complete some stories within a Sprint however this is wrong it shouldn't be pressure to complete the stories instead we should forecast what can be done within a Sprint only because we cannot do every story in the backlog that needs to be some prioritization and so we just so happen to have picked this chunk of stories to focus on right now in this Sprint if we happen to get more done more stories done the spring and that's fantastic if it's less that's still okay we do need to try to make sure that the software is in working condition and ready for deployment when we get the end of the Sprint essentially there's a stepping stone approach here's a graph that shows how this works on the vertical part it shows departure from deployability and the bottom axis is time so we should try not to go too far away from being a deployable application and we should have said skip across the stepping Stones so that we are generally always in a deployable situation at the end of the Sprint we should be in a deployable situation 

The consequence of not completing the stories just means that the stories move to the next spring there's nothing to feel bad about it is just. It just means that the estimation is not accurate and that can happen it's just fine the consequence is that we may have spent some time talking about some stories that didn't get done and maybe that was premature to be discussing these stories ideally we would be in an ideal world we would only be discussing the stories that are going to be done in the Sprint because once we finish the Sprint and we have been deploying and receiving feedback we can we can use that feedback to help form and further detail out Future stories and so we don't want those stories in the Sprint because stories in the Sprint should generally not be changed stories in the backlog can be easily changed because they're not currently in progress.
