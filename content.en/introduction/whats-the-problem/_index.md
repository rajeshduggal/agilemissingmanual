# What's the Problem?


It's interesting how many people are working as a scrum master or agile coach and they don't not aware that the original founders of the many of the original founders of the agile manifesto aren't on board with the way that scrima Nigel is being not only implemented but how is being taught and many of the courses and certifications and by many of the organizations that build the software tools the reason for this I feel is that the original manifesto wasn't didn't address what the project manager does it was designed as a it was designed from to be from the perspective of the software development team that is building and delivering software the stakeholders essentially the team is self-managing however we do still reduce the experience obstacles and so we do still need somebody a person to take on the role to help clear the path in front and bring people together or people person to help manage the different moving parts that are happening and across teams and also to liaison across teams and to help organize and schedule various meetings and manage the calendar and direct the team I think this is the I think this is what makes sense for project manager to do with an energy or something that is still very important

Having said all that I don't feel as a project manager that should dictate how this should be done the analogy I like to the analogy I like to use is that of a restaurant where you have a kitchen staff team and they are one second
The kitchen staff know all about cooking they know about food ingredients how to and how to run a kitchen sometimes some some kitchens restaurant kitchens will organize themselves into various food stations one for gravies and sauces one for vegetables one for meats and when an order comes in a ticket comes into the kitchen the team will organize themselves to collaborate and work together to prepare all the items so that they are all all hot and ready to be eaten at the same time and served plate plated on one plate and and send out of the kitchen in the way they're collaborating the more efficiently and smoothly the team can collaborate the more streamlined and fast flowing are the tickets processed but where is the project manager in the scenario in this case I would say the manager is the restaurant manager he generally he or she generally doesn't need to be going into the kitchen and directing the cooks the chefs the chefs know how to prepare the food and the restaurant manager doesn't need to be too concerned of that however there are some man just still needs to make sure that the restaurant as a whole is working well but the customers happy and they feeling heard is the wait stop taking the oldest correctly is everything in the kitchen working the ovens the knives the utensils is there any other problems happening are the customers complaints being any customer complaints or concerns being addressed is everything running smoothly who is monitoring the solar system these are the things that the project manager needs to be on top of of the restaurant manager needs to be on top of if the restaurant manager were to go and spend that time in the kitchen and being too involved in what's going on there then since they haven't cooked before since they have not necessarily been a chef before they may they may distract from what the chef team are trying to accomplish instead they should trust that the chefs in the kitchen know how to prepare the food and fulfill the tickets that are coming in from the customer I see this many times where the project manager starts getting too involved in the with the where the tickets are being processed and being done or sometimes even the developers will bring in the project manager and Fielding you to explain everything on take direction from the project manager but instead the developers should come together and collaborate themselves with each other book meetings and decide how things need to be done amongst themselves to complete the tickets and only escalate to the project manager when it's something that the project manager should be concerned with for example tooling issues or resource issues or if there's some problem without taking can be addressed also even though if we consider the waiter as the business analyst who is gathering the requirements from the customer out in the dining room and bringing it back into the kitchen if the chefs have some issue with how the order is written or isn't able to fulfill a customized request on the ticket they can talk directly to the waiter AKA the business analyst they don't need to bring the product manager into the conversation and put your manager and work on bigger items more and work on the items and should have confidence that the developers have been done on the list can discuss amongst themselves
