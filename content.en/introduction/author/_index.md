# Who is Raj Duggal?

So, you're curious to know who wrote this, and why?  I'll tell you...

It's been a long long journey for me.  28 years as an I.T professional.

I began my software development career here in Toronto, back in the mid 90s.

Back in the 90s, it was typical for software projects to be based on a gating system.  Where the project went through distinct scheduled phases. 

First was the design phase, then development, then testing, until it was eventually deployed into production.

But!, only after the stakeholders agreed that everything looked good, and they signed off that all the work was complete,  and they wouldn't be asked for more changes.

Between each of the phases there was a "gate" where the stakeholders needed to sign-off to formally agree that they felt the project was ready to move to the next phase. 


It was pretty common for the stakeholders to delay and resist signing off for as long as the project schedule would allow, until they felt very very confident that all the needed work in the phase was "done". Because they didn't want any one complaining if they wanted to go back and change something.

And, in the situations where a stakeholder decided that some new change would be needed, there was a "change control" process, to formalize the "change request" process.

For most projects, it was generally considered a bad thing if changes happened mid-way through the project.

The thing is... change always always happened. It was **inevitable**!

In pretty much every software project I've been involved in.  And so most projects had this internal built in pressure, conflict, and negotiation that no one liked, but everyone knew they would need to deal with at some point during the project.

The [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) provided a launching board to encourage  conversations to re-assess the way we've been developming software from a first-principles approach.

Since change is inevitable. How can we develop and deliver software in way that embraces the idea of "change" into the development process.  Rather than trying to fight it.


Over the years, I've worked on many many client engagements, and I've seen the popularity of "agile" grow. Yet! It seems, unfortunately, that in most cases, the underlying ideas are being missed at a foundational level.  And it seems that many of the participants of agile projects, are using the buzz words, but not understanding why these practices exist. And how they feed into project success.
