# Who is Raj Duggal?
So, you’re curious to know who's behind this website and why I built it?

I'll tell you…

It’s been quite the journey—over 25 years in I.T.

My software development career started here in Toronto in the mid-90s, a time when tech was very different from today. Back then, software projects followed a strict, systematic, defined, step-by-step approach to building software projects. It was based on distinct project phases with gating between each phase.

The phases included: design, development, testing, and finally, deployment. It all seemed very sensible at the time, but there was a catch!: each phase needed a formal sign-off before moving to the next, which meant endless back-and-forth to get everything “just right” before advancing.

In those days, stakeholders would often hold off on signing until they felt 110% sure that everything was perfect, as any further tweaks would require a tedious “change control” process. Change was seen as a problem, something to avoid, and a cause for long debates and delays.

But here’s the reality—change *always* happens. I can’t think of a single project where something didn’t need adjusting midway. Yet, this old-school process led to friction, delays, and a lot of stress all around.

The [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) was a game-changer. It encouraged us to rethink software development from the ground up, embracing change rather than resisting it. The big question was, “Since change is inevitable, why not build it right into the process?”

Since then, I’ve worked with countless clients and watched agile evolve into one of the most popular approaches in software development. But here’s the thing: even though agile is everywhere now, I often see teams missing the core of what it’s really about. They’re using the lingo, but sometimes without fully understanding the purpose behind these practices—how they’re meant to make projects more adaptable, collaborative, and ultimately successful.

So, that’s me—a long-time software developer, coach, and consultant, with a focus on helping teams understand and truly *live* the agile mindset. After all, it’s not about rigidly following processes or sticking to buzzwords; it’s about adapting, growing, and delivering something truly valuable.
