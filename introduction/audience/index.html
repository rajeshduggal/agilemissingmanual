<a class=anchor href=#ive-never-heard-of-agile>#</a></h2><p>This is not for you. But if you really want to know. It&rsquo;s a software development approach that emerged from a discussion session at a software development conference in 2001. It&rsquo;s based on the idea of setting things up to embrace the envitable change that happens during almost all software development projects.</p><h2 id=i-dont-know-what-agile-is-but-someone-told-me-we-do-it-here>I don&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;agile&rdquo; is, but someone told me we do it here.
<a class=anchor href=#i-dont-know-what-agile-is-but-someone-told-me-we-do-it-here>#</a></h2><p>This is probably not for you. But you can pass this website url along to the agile team. They might find it interesting.</p><p>And if you really want to know what this manual is about&mldr;</p><p>There isn&rsquo;t a step by step clear guide on how to do agile. And so many software development teams approach it differently. Which is just fine.</p><p>Agile development is an approach to incrementally and interatively evolve the software being developed by rapidly getting the newly developed software features working and available for the users to use, so we can get feedback and use it to steer and drive the software development direction forward.</p><p>Many teams involved in this software development approach are missing some key understandings of what it means to run a software development project with agility in mind. And that&rsquo;s the information that this manual is offering.</p><h2 id=ive-heard-of-agile-and-ive-started-learning-about-it>I&rsquo;ve heard of agile and I&rsquo;ve started learning about it
<a class=anchor href=#ive-heard-of-agile-and-ive-started-learning-about-it>#</a></h2><p>Yes, this is for you!, Welcome!</p><p>Unfortunately, You&rsquo;ll find a lot of contradictory information online about what agile is at a high level. There&rsquo;s a lot of mis-conceptions and mis-understanding of what it is, and what it&rsquo;s about. Many teams use a lot of the terminology and do the different ceremonies (stand-up meetings, release planning, etc) But they don&rsquo;t understand the importance of how these practices and ceremonies feed into the values.</p><h2 id=im-involved-with-a-team-that-is-doing-agile>I&rsquo;m involved with a team that is doing &ldquo;agile&rdquo;.
<a class=anchor href=#im-involved-with-a-team-that-is-doing-agile>#</a></h2><p>Yes, this is for you!, Welcome!</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to say that although there&rsquo;s a lot of information in this manual. It&rsquo;s not all compulsary to follow. There is no one-size-fits-all cookie cutter approach. But! there are some high level concepts and ideas that we are striving for when deciding what practices, techniques, and processes to put in place.</p><p>Hopefully the information in this manual will convey those high level concepts so that teams can model or directly use the techniques and practices described in this manual.</p><h2 id=im-in-an-agile-team-and-loving-it>I&rsquo;m in an agile team and loving it!
<a class=anchor href=#im-in-an-agile-team-and-loving-it>#</a></h2><p>Fantastic! You&rsquo;ve very lucky! Perhaps your team has a good understanding of how agile is used to create balance and harmony between the stakeholders and development teams, so that that they co-operate together with a shared unified goal of project success. And you&rsquo;re all working together to capture the most ROI and allowing each other the space they need to make the project a enjoyable positive experience.</p><h2 id=im-in-an-agile-team-and-hating-it>I&rsquo;m in an agile team and hating it!
<a class=anchor href=#im-in-an-agile-team-and-hating-it>#</a></h2><p>Oh no! Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t a rare thing. When you read articles online. You&rsquo;ll often find two different types of articles. Those that talk about how agile is about collaboration and positivity amongst the team.</p><p>Or you&rsquo;ll read articles that are skeptical and talk about how agile isn&rsquo;t really the silver bullet that it&rsquo;s described as. And in some articles they&rsquo;ll talk about how agile is anti-pattern, or snake oil.</p><p>I hope that when you look through this manual, you&rsquo;ll be able to identify where in your team things aren&rsquo;t properly following the high level concepts of agile development, and you&rsquo;ll find the source of frustration in your team. And be able to offer a different approach to your team that will ease some of the pressure and frustration.</p><p>Feel free to reach out to me if you&rsquo;d like to discuss the problems you&rsquo;re feeling in your team. And perhaps I can give you some suggestions for you consider bringing to your team.</p><h2 id=im-running-an-agile-team-and-things-are-going-pretty-well>I&rsquo;m running an agile team and things are going pretty well
<a class=anchor href=#im-running-an-agile-team-and-things-are-going-pretty-well>#</a></h2><p>Super! Well done! Please reach out to me and tell me what you feel some of the key reasons are of why/how you were able to get buy in and success in your team.</p><p>Perhaps there&rsquo;s some additional information you can give me that your gleaned from your experience running an agile development project. And I can add some of those golden nuggets into this manual!</p><h2 id=im-running-an-agile-team-and-its-a-struggle>I&rsquo;m running an agile team and it&rsquo;s a struggle
<a class=anchor href=#im-running-an-agile-team-and-its-a-struggle>#</a></h2><p>I hear you. It&rsquo;s not easy to get the team onboard with agile. I usually find that some people on the team have worked in other agile development projects and have many notions of how it&rsquo;s supposed to go. And have been practicing some techniques that might seem sensible, but aren&rsquo;t aligned with the effective nature of agile, and instead are more rigid and efficient. And really there needs to a balance between the two (But probably siding more on the &ldquo;efficieny&rdquo; side of things.)</p><p>sometimes there&rsquo;s just one or two things that need adjusting to turn things around and make the experience more enjoyable for everyone. And that will reduce some of the pressure and frustration.</p><p>It&rsquo;s funny how often I hear people in teams complaining because someone changed their mind on a requirement. Or because the developers are having difficulty changing the existing application code. Not understanding that &ldquo;change&rdquo; is a core fundamental aspect of the agile development approach!</p><h2 id=im-running-an-agile-team-and-its-not-working>I&rsquo;m running an agile team and it&rsquo;s not working
<a class=anchor href=#im-running-an-agile-team-and-its-not-working>#</a></h2><p>Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Take a look at this manual, and see if you can identify some aspects of how agile development is being done in your team, and perhaps needs to be done differently.</p><p>Also please reach out to me, and we can discuss what problems the team is facing, and perhaps I can offere some suggestions to fix it.</p><h2 id=ive-just-passed-an-agilecertification-exam>I&rsquo;ve just passed an agile/certification exam
<a class=anchor href=#ive-just-passed-an-agilecertification-exam>#</a></h2><p>Congratulations! Well done, that&rsquo;s exciting!</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure the learning you recieved during your training for the exam will be of great use for your projects and teams!</p><p>Hopefully, the information on this site aligns with the things you learned during your studies. If there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s not aligned. Please reach out to me and let me know about it. I&rsquo;m really curious to know which concepts they&rsquo;re teaching are different to what&rsquo;s described on this site.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#ive-never-heard-of-agile>I&rsquo;ve never heard of &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=#i-dont-know-what-agile-is-but-someone-told-me-we-do-it-here>I don&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;agile&rdquo; is, but someone told me we do it here.</a></li><li><a href=#ive-heard-of-agile-and-ive-started-learning-about-it>I&rsquo;ve heard of agile and I&rsquo;ve started learning about it</a></li><li><a href=#im-involved-with-a-team-that-is-doing-agile>I&rsquo;m involved with a team that is doing &ldquo;agile&rdquo;.</a></li><li><a href=#im-in-an-agile-team-and-loving-it>I&rsquo;m in an agile team and loving it!</a></li><li><a href=#im-in-an-agile-team-and-hating-it>I&rsquo;m in an agile team and hating it!</a></li><li><a href=#im-running-an-agile-team-and-things-are-going-pretty-well>I&rsquo;m running an agile team and things are going pretty well</a></li><li><a href=#im-running-an-agile-team-and-its-a-struggle>I&rsquo;m running an agile team and it&rsquo;s a struggle</a></li><li><a href=#im-running-an-agile-team-and-its-not-working>I&rsquo;m running an agile team and it&rsquo;s not working</a></li><li><a href=#ive-just-passed-an-agilecertification-exam>I&rsquo;ve just passed an agile/certification exam</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
