  Split User Stories into Two Parts: For the Product Owner and the Implementors
  #

One of the challenges teams often face is balancing clarity between what the product owner envisions and what the development team needs to know to make it happen. To streamline this, consider splitting user stories into two distinct sections: a top half for the product owner’s &ldquo;ask&rdquo; and a bottom half for the implementors’ technical notes."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://AgileMissingManual.com/practices-and-techniques/split-user-stories-into-two-parts/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Agile Missing Manual"><meta property="og:title" content="Split User Stories into Two Parts"><meta property="og:description" content="Split User Stories into Two Parts: For the Product Owner and the Implementors # One of the challenges teams often face is balancing clarity between what the product owner envisions and what the development team needs to know to make it happen.

<a class=anchor href=#split-user-stories-into-two-parts-for-the-product-owner-and-the-implementors>#</a></h1><p>One of the challenges teams often face is balancing clarity between what the product owner envisions and what the development team needs to know to make it happen. To streamline this, consider <strong>splitting user stories into two distinct sections</strong>: a top half for the product owner’s &ldquo;ask&rdquo; and a bottom half for the implementors’ technical notes.</p><h3 id=why-split-user-stories>Why Split User Stories?
<a class=anchor href=#why-split-user-stories>#</a></h3><p>The purpose of this approach is to keep the user story simple, clear, and free-flowing, while still giving the team the flexibility to jot down technical notes. This format encourages clarity, keeps the product owner’s requirements front and center, and allows developers to add technical details without cluttering the product owner’s main vision.</p><p>Let’s look at the two parts in detail.</p><h3 id=the-top-part-for-the-product-owner>The Top Part: For the Product Owner
<a class=anchor href=#the-top-part-for-the-product-owner>#</a></h3><p>In the first part, the product owner describes what they want in their own words. This part should:</p><ul><li>Be written in language the product owner understands.</li><li>Clearly describe the &ldquo;ask&rdquo; without any technical jargon.</li><li>Be simple enough that the product owner could ideally write it themselves.</li></ul><p>When the product owner phrases the request themselves, it becomes more accessible to all team members, helping them understand the feature from the user’s perspective. This section should contain everything the product owner wants and expects, capturing the “why” behind the feature.</p><h3 id=example>Example
<a class=anchor href=#example>#</a></h3><p>Let’s say the product owner wants a calendar component on a web page. Here’s how the top part might look:</p><p><strong>Top Half (for the Product Owner)</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Add a calendar listing of events for this month. Ideally, the calendar should appear in a grid format, and the user should be able to easily navigate to other years and months.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This part should be as clear and straightforward as possible, focusing on what the product owner wants the user to experience.</p><h3 id=the-horizontal-rule-separating-vision-from-implementation>The Horizontal Rule: Separating Vision from Implementation
<a class=anchor href=#the-horizontal-rule-separating-vision-from-implementation>#</a></h3><p>Add a simple horizontal rule (a divider line) beneath the product owner’s description. This visually separates the “ask” from the technical considerations. It’s a minor touch but helps distinguish what’s essential for the product owner from what’s needed by the developers.</p><h3 id=the-bottom-part-for-the-implementors>The Bottom Part: For the Implementors
<a class=anchor href=#the-bottom-part-for-the-implementors>#</a></h3><p>Below the divider, the implementors can add their own notes, assumptions, or considerations. This section is purely optional, intended to help developers by giving them a place to record any relevant technology choices, coding considerations, or dependencies.</p><p>This part doesn’t need to be structured or formal. Developers can write freely, recording whatever notes they feel will help clarify the implementation for the rest of the team.</p><p><strong>Bottom Half (for the Implementors)</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Check the UI component library to see if it already includes a calendar widget. If not, explore the ABC library to find a suitable calendar component.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3 id=use-one-text-area-for-both-parts>Use One Text Area for Both Parts
<a class=anchor href=#use-one-text-area-for-both-parts>#</a></h3><p>For maximum flexibility, avoid adding two separate text areas for each section. Having one combined text area makes it easy to adjust the story on the fly. You can copy, paste, and rearrange content between the two sections as needed, or even split the story into new parts if necessary—all without switching between fields.</p><h3 id=flexibility-is-key>Flexibility is Key
<a class=anchor href=#flexibility-is-key>#</a></h3><p>While this two-part structure can be helpful, it shouldn’t be forced onto every story. Agile teams thrive on flexibility, so keep this approach as an optional tool rather than a mandatory structure. Some stories may not need any technical notes at all, while others may benefit from extensive developer insight. Use this split format when it enhances clarity but feel free to go without it when a story is self-explanatory.</p><h3 id=summary-of-benefits>Summary of Benefits
<a class=anchor href=#summary-of-benefits>#</a></h3><p>Splitting user stories this way can:</p><ol><li>Make the product owner’s vision clearer for everyone on the team.</li><li>Provide a natural space for implementors to capture technical notes.</li><li>Create a simple, flexible structure that’s easy to rearrange, copy, or split as needed.</li><li>Allow agile teams to keep user stories clean, collaborative, and easy to understand.</li></ol><p>Use this structure to keep stories light and adaptable, while still giving both the product owner and the development team the clarity they need to create great features.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div></main></body></html>
